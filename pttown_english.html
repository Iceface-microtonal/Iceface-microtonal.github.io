                <p>A butterfly danced in the wind and fell to the roadside like paper.<br>
The sun illuminated the butterfly, and the butterfly received the sun on its back.<br>
Shadow began to push against light, the meridian cut the butterfly in two, as if the butterfly immersed half of its body in two different worlds.<br>
Thus the shadow advanced, enveloping the butterfly.</p><br>

                <p>When I peered into the shrine, it appeared empty inside,<br>
but in the filtering sunlight, there was one butterfly dancing within.<br>
When I hesitated whether to open it or not,<br>
the door opened and the butterfly emerged,<br>
dancing before me, seeming to guide me somewhere. Following the butterfly, I came to an unknown path. The butterfly occasionally circled around me as it moved forward. At the end of the straight path, the butterfly suddenly vanished. When I turned around, the path had disappeared.</p><br>

                <h3>The Outline Butterfly</h3>
                <p>There is a butterfly that flies only in outlines. As the moon waxes, the butterfly's outline becomes clearer, and on the night of the full moon, it flies beautifully with intricate patterns. As the moon wanes, the patterns become invisible, and on the new moon, though its form is absent, only the presence of wingbeats can be felt. The residents are all enchanted by this butterfly, catching it to look through it at the sky and observing it in insect cages.</p><br>

                <h3>Insects That Ride on Voices</h3>
                <p>Small, round, black things were flying above the forest. It was as if someone had thrown a ball vertically into the sky.<br>
I carefully observed where they were flying from, and they seemed to fly toward where the higurashi cicadas were singing.<br>
When I quietly approached the source of the voices, I found a higurashi clinging to a branch, singing.<br>
Next to the higurashi, many small, round stink bugs were lined up in a row on the branch.<br>
When the higurashi stopped singing, the first stink bug in line climbed onto the higurashi's head.<br>
The higurashi didn't brush it away and seemed to quietly prepare for its next song.<br>
As I watched, suddenly the higurashi began to sing. Launched by that voice, the stink bug flew vigorously up to the forest canopy without opening its wings, and from there began flying on its own power.<br>
By riding on the voice, the stink bug seemed to gain speed and distance.<br>
Several stink bugs took turns riding on the higurashi's voice, but when the higurashi completely stopped singing, all the remaining stink bugs flew away on their own wings.</p><br>

                <p>At night, there were two water striders in the well. The moonlight entering from above created shadows of the water striders, and they were absorbed in stretching and lifting one leg, fascinated by their own shadows reflected on the water surface. As the moon gradually rose higher, their long shadows began to poke at each other, and when they put their bodies on each other's shadows, the ripples on the water surface grew larger. When a bird passed over the well and a great shadow crossed the water surface, the water striders were startled and seemed to discuss what that had been. When the moon passed over the well and light no longer shone on the water surface, the water striders stopped playing and floated quietly on the water.</p><br>

                <h3>The Millipede's Bedtime Companion</h3>
                <p>I would pick up millipedes walking on the tatami and put them outside. From beside me, different millipedes would walk on the tatami. After repeatedly picking up and removing millipedes, I laid out my futon and hung up the mosquito net. After getting into the futon for a while, a millipede entered my field of vision. I watched as the millipede searched for gaps in the mosquito net and entered through a gap it found. At first, I flicked it with my finger to get it outside the net, but when it repeatedly entered the net, since it only curled up on the tatami and showed no sign of climbing onto the futon, I decided to just sleep. When morning came, the millipede was still curled up. When I began to put away the mosquito net, the millipede stretched its body and hurriedly began walking on the tatami. The next day too, when I hung up the net, it entered and curled up. When morning came and I began to put away the net, the millipede started moving. In August, the millipede disappeared.</p><br>
